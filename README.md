# Simple GitHub Pages Video Page

This is intentionally simple: it shows one full-screen video player for `M4V00943.MP4`.

## What you need to do

1. Keep `M4V00943.MP4` in the repository root.
2. Push this branch to GitHub.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
4. Set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** your default branch, folder `/ (root)`
5. Open your Pages URL.

If the video does not load, confirm the file name is exactly `M4V00943.MP4`.
