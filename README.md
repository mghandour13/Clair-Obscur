# Simple GitHub Pages Video Page

This page is intentionally minimal and now shows only two controls:
- Play / Pause
- Fullscreen

No duration, no current time, and no progress bar are shown.

## Setup

1. Keep your video file in repo root: `M4V00943.MP4`
2. Push to GitHub.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
4. Set source to your deploy branch and folder `/ (root)`
5. Open your Pages URL and hard-refresh once (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)

## If it still does not play

- Confirm the file exists in the same branch selected in Pages settings.
- Wait 1-2 minutes for Pages deployment.
- Check exact filename casing: `M4V00943.MP4`.
