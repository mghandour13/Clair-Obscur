# Simple GitHub Pages Video Page

This page is intentionally minimal: a full-screen video player, nothing else.

## Setup

1. Keep your video file in repo root: `M4V00943.MP4`
2. Push to GitHub.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
4. Set source to your deploy branch and folder `/ (root)`
5. Open your Pages URL and hard-refresh once (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)

## If it still does not play

- Confirm the file exists in the same branch selected in Pages settings.
- Wait 1-2 minutes for Pages deployment.
- Check exact filename casing: `M4V00943.MP4`.
This is intentionally simple: it shows one full-screen video player for `M4V00943.MP4`.

## What you need to do

1. Keep `M4V00943.MP4` in the repository root.
2. Push this branch to GitHub.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
4. Set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** your default branch, folder `/ (root)`
5. Open your Pages URL.

If the video does not load, confirm the file name is exactly `M4V00943.MP4`.
